You can casually play 4-5 levels a day for when you're in a bus or in a line. But if you are more competitive, you can set your goals much higher. You can even compete with people around the world and be the first to complete all 10,000 levels. You can check the online leaderboards after each level you complete to see where you stand in the world.\r\nIt might start easy at first. Anyone might be able to win the first 10 levels. But those are just for warm up. As you progress the levels will become extremely challenging. Then, to progress further, you will have to rethink your choices more than once. Ready for this epic challenge? Start playing now!\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Why should I play ***\r\n\r\n★ Easy to play: Just tap on the pairs that add up to 13\r\n★ Levels are short and relaxing. Also good for 1 minute breaks. \r\n★ 10,000 winnable levels that guarantee you thousands of hours of relaxing fun;\r\n★ Advanced Hint option and Undo to help you make even better choices along the way;\r\n★ 4 different card styles to fit your preferences and for better seeing;\r\n★ 5 background styles;\r\n★ Natural animations, beautiful graphics and a very intuitive interface;\r\n★ For the more avid players, take notice: Even if you play 10 minutes a day, you will still need 3+ years to complete all levels ;) . \r\n\r\n\r\n*** How to play ***\r\n\r\n- The goal of the game is to clear as many boards as possible by tapping any two cards that add up to exactly 13. For example, you can tap a 10 and a 3, or an 8 and a 5. Aces count as 1, Jacks count as 11, Queens count as 12 and Kings count as 13.\r\n- You can tap away the king with just one move. To eliminate a queen, you need to match it with an ace.\r\n- You can match any uncovered card. \r\n- If there are no more available matches, press \"Draw\" to draw cards from the deck below. You can draw the entire stack three times over. \r\n\r\n\r\n♥♥ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Its really easy to pick up and play and difficult to put down. Its simple to play but still has a strategic component to it\r\n\r\nThe objective of Uno Card Game is to empty all your cards before the other players get rid of theirs. The player reduces cards by discarding cards that match the top card in the Discard pile.\r\n\r\nUse the special action cards to frustrate your fellow players by stealing turns away from them. Match the colour or the number of the last card on the discard stack to play your cards.\r\n\r\nUno with Friends - Card Game is a very simple color and number matching game. The deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are 25 of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. The ranks in each color are zero to nine, \"Skip\", \"Draw Two\", and \"Reverse\" (the last three being \"action cards\"). In addition, the deck contains four each of \"Wild\" and \"Wild Draw Four\" cards\r\n\r\nEach player is dealt 7 cards and the remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile. The first player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number or color or the player can throw down a Wild Card else he must pick a card from the draw pile. If he can play what is drawn, great.

scientist who predicted the fall of mankind and civilization. It doesn't know what has transpired in the wake of the fall or why the world has become so rowdy and violent, all it knows is it hasn't made an arrest in 1230 years and it's got some catching up to do. As it takes in the sheer number of people rioting the earth, the copbot's cloning activates and as he travels beyond the borders of his rebirth, his clones spawn and reign their strict laws over the town. As one of the world's last remaining superheroes, working a desk job at the local precinct, when a mob of copbots storm the district, taking out citizens left and right, he knows he must take a stand and classes from this menace. \r\n\r\nCops Vs Robbers - Survival Craft is a thrilling first person shooter adventure where you can enjoy real time battle with friends and foes from all over the globe. With over 40 weapons to create, equip and use including guns, rockets, grenades, bows, swords and gems, you'll be ready to blow past enemies with stunning finesse. Take out enemies creating or utilizing a plethora of unique strategies or even shoot through walls when you see oncoming enemies approaching on the areal entity map. Collect your daily reward by viewing short video ads, then select your difficulty level and begin fighting. In this initial map, you will be fighting against the clock in order to earn a powerful permanent weapon to carry with you throughout the game. The level will instruct you in the number of enemies you'll need to defeat and the time you'll be given to perform this feat. If you don't succeed the first time, you'll be offered another chance, or you can move on to the next level without this bonus weapon. When you reach level six you will unlock the multiplayer option.

mindblowing bike racing action set in a huge urban sprawl called The City. Separated into a set of districts, each with its own look and real feel. Prepare for heart-stopping and breathtaking thrills you have never seen in mobile games before.\r\n\r\nRIDE EPIC BIKES\r\nRace on a huge selection of easily customizable motorcycles ranging from badass choppers to fast motocross bikes. All prepped up, loaded with nitro and ready to unleash their full fury on the asphalt below.\r\nThere’s also a treat for all of the dirt fanatics out there - you can drive real quads. Experience speed that cannot be stopped by anything less than a brick wall!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE THE BIGGEST AND THE BADDEST\r\nFeel the adrenaline overload as you start racing against the biker gangs that rule The City. They are the famous 1%, the outlaw bike racers who thrive on crime and their need for the rush of speed. They believe that all of the best things in the world are for free (when you take them forcibly) and that having fun in life is the only thing that matters.

Spending money on different objects that we simply don't need is definitely not a smart thing to do. However, sales could be also very useful. We wish to have certain object or we really need it but its price is simply too high. In that case we wait for the sale and get them on reasonable price.\r\n\r\nMartha and Lori work as shop assistants in one small shopping center. Traditionally, every year, they organize sales that has been very famous in the city where they live. It is something like a holiday because the sale always offers rather decreased prices so everyone could afford to buy the object that he/she always wanted. People even decide not to go to work on this day and dedicate the whole day on shopping. That way they will save some money and allow themselves different modern objects and clothes.\r\n\r\nEven though this day is a really wonderful and noble day, Martha and Lori know that this will be a rather difficult day for them, with a lot of hard work.

Be careful not to fly out of the road into the ocean.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PDJ9FP762XJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jigsaw Puzzles Epic 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8613.14149277342502055.f37e0bfa-537c-4899-9653-43e5ea0ec18e.061578e6-59e2-44da-843e-0b3cfc71792c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.294.14149277342502055.f37e0bfa-537c-4899-9653-43e5ea0ec18e.ac8d1ed7-9203-466b-9627-959e203cbfe0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["59638RoyalVoodooCSGOGames.JigsawPuzzlesEpic3D_sj1p1fck19wk0"],"ContentIds":["4fed8408-852a-9301-e7e5-1547e74135ab","da6a9e1c-b73e-e607-e321-33ffdaebddc1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Jigsaw Puzzles Epic is a jigsaw game with beautiful pictures in a wide variety of categories.

Do you have what it takes to survive the online battle arena mayhem? Throw an ice bomb, dodge, travel through a wormhole, slap the guy next to you – do whatever it takes to be the last Jelly alive when the smoke settles. In the end, only the winners will be remembered!\r\n\r\nBUILD AND UPGRADE\r\nOnce you feel like adding some more fire power to your weaponry take over the Jelly Island and get your hands dirty. Gather resources, upgrade buildings, research blueprints and build even more powerful bombs to show your enemies who’s not to mess with. Keep an eye on the Island’s coastline every once in a while, though, you never know what might drift ashore from the ocean. And one more piece of advice: keep leveling up - your opponents will! \r\n\r\nENDLESS CUSTOMIZATION\r\nGetting tired on your Jelly’s looks? No problem! With over 100 items ranging from freckles to sunglasses the options to change your character's looks are almost limitless. How about a handsome fella with a goatee and a Christmas hat? No? Maybe you’d fancy pigtails with a monocle? Either way, the decision is yours to make and your opponents to bear with when they encounter your beautiful self on the battlefield.

Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM4J4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Extreme Nitro Racing 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43460.9007199266433819.99b1431e-6646-4061-b86b-84cc644efbe4.01afe858-69b2-4bda-8dc3-b6e71f7e763b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#00540a","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31040.9007199266433819.492a1a8a-ee33-4567-a277-b9919a047813.2f974401-cd35-43fd-886f-cf1cd8b957fd","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#00540a","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["SkippyAppsPtyLtd.ExtremeNitroRacing3D_kf9hk7mcakwce"],"ContentIds":["23887d48-ed4b-1329-9054-5f38f6e09492"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Extreme Nitro Racing 3D gives you an ultimate car physics engine, intelligent opponent racers, an amazing circuit track, four different types of controls, an engaging soundtrack and the thrill you've been looking for.

adventures of young Ingolf await you! New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins.
