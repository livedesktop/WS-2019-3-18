One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N4W0QFH8BTW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mystery Tales: The Twilight World","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35741.13979535271604902.0a48d9a8-7751-4f6a-bcf1-4e3e959bc3df.e64b29b6-0d2a-46d0-ad8c-8dda52aeabe1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42489.13979535271604902.0a48d9a8-7751-4f6a-bcf1-4e3e959bc3df.1ea80807-d081-43cf-b32c-e4fbc8f775e1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13816.13979535271604902.0a48d9a8-7751-4f6a-bcf1-4e3e959bc3df.afaacc5c-647b-4b86-9a2e-070991720dd2","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38463.13979535271604902.0a48d9a8-7751-4f6a-bcf1-4e3e959bc3df.f2e1f098-a6d4-4a25-ad2c-358915011d19","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£8.39","Price":8.39,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.MysteryTalesTheTwilightWorld_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["23388605-7e93-562c-bc56-1b35f8f2a463"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"From DominiGames, creators of the Labyrinths of the World, Dark Romance, and Mystery Tales series, comes an all-new tale of mystery to enjoy!\r\n\r\nYou and your daughter, Nancy, can't resist the lovely hotel just off the highway, especially after a long day on the open road.

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

It changes due to the person's actions and affects his/her rights and liberties. Citizens with higher rating have more benefits, and zero rating means forced liquidation of the person.\r\n\r\nBecause of a technical error you have received a rating that was even below zero: -0.01. Theoretically, this is simply impossible, and now you \"do not exist\": electronic devices do not identify you, officials and public services refuse to deal with you because of a system error. Now you can't even buy food or pay for treatment.\r\n\r\nTrying to obtain justice is useless, and the only way out is to hack the government server where the rating base of citizens is stored and edit the data on it. It's very difficult because the server is controlled by a quantum computer, and huge processing power is needed to overcome the quantum encryption. Your home computer is definitely unable to do this, so you need something more powerful.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Expand and develop a network of computers, decide when it is powerful enough to crack the quantum server;\r\n- Use the power of your network to mine cryptocurrency, earning funds for further upgrades and improvements;\r\n- Beware of the police and Cyber Control that can track down your suspicious activity and confiscate (or even burn) your equipment;\r\n- As the story goes, it becomes even more complicated: you thought that its only your own fate that depends on your actions, but it suddenly turns out that everything is more global...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG2GW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Supermarket Management 2 HD (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.39647.9007199266304656.86055cab-849d-419e-bb36-e2332ae6dda8.4ea5d28b-203e-4047-b645-5145ccc9e4ce","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13931.9007199266304656.c4eb9a0c-ae0a-406b-ac63-ed23e9d8d43b.3803b10c-2a44-46a6-823e-99e53f851ed2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.44960.9007199266304656.5a13e8fe-59ce-445d-ba76-4296f460e077.d482e5da-db8f-4c4a-88a5-dec892fd37db","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.42706.9007199266304656.d75fd4e6-30fa-4f4e-a872-2d672477a031.c7e5a758-454e-4a53-8922-a3427c71c713","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.41008.9007199266304656.c70e159a-53d5-4cbc-bd3b-76d2c56dbf9e.305f476f-7ea4-4c0d-bde1-825909a9d0f2","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.364.9007199266304656.8c08f2a6-a558-4486-9c6c-c351886af378.b5caf662-17ce-448b-8137-bc2352d3270f","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£5.79⁺","Price":5.79,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"48","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.SupermarketManagementFull_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["69095475-4355-4049-ada5-7ea7173cc909"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you have what it takes to run a busy supermarket?

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH2SSC6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sparkle Epic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33875.13510798884786903.3519d26c-d829-401f-971b-f6a6bc803b82.3a01eee5-955a-4578-95ae-1dbaab578967","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#53b3f3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1254.13510798884786903.bc3179c9-a2c7-4cbe-a3e1-1e274ac6eedb.b7a7354d-4ecd-4bb1-8929-bb9ad5dfbf2d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#53b3f3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13627.13510798884786903.8f280a56-11dd-49d7-bebd-139331c85c97.5d62342d-bd3e-43dc-89ae-d00ac9b394a3","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#53b3f3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11055.13510798884786903.5f7ecc8d-b966-4f4b-b287-8b1e0db8bd21.6d280309-3a25-4241-a1b5-85d20661e6ee","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#53b3f3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.6,"RatingsCount":"17","PackageFamilyNames":["43844A19.SparkleEpic_j6tmt3vnwnhry"],"ContentIds":["2e2a7947-227e-a954-1be3-697b467c9b58","e03a35c2-50c8-67f2-eed3-fa80c04e897f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Sparkle Epic is a tremendously entertaining marble popper action puzzle game.

Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

You can casually play 4-5 levels a day for when you're in a bus or in a line. But if you are more competitive, you can set your goals much higher. You can even compete with people around the world and be the first to complete all 10,000 levels. You can check the online leaderboards after each level you complete to see where you stand in the world.\r\nIt might start easy at first. Anyone might be able to win the first 10 levels. But those are just for warm up. As you progress the levels will become extremely challenging. Then, to progress further, you will have to rethink your choices more than once. Ready for this epic challenge? Start playing now!\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Why should I play ***\r\n\r\n★ Easy to play: Just tap on the pairs that add up to 13\r\n★ Levels are short and relaxing. Also good for 1 minute breaks. \r\n★ 10,000 winnable levels that guarantee you thousands of hours of relaxing fun;\r\n★ Advanced Hint option and Undo to help you make even better choices along the way;\r\n★ 4 different card styles to fit your preferences and for better seeing;\r\n★ 5 background styles;\r\n★ Natural animations, beautiful graphics and a very intuitive interface;\r\n★ For the more avid players, take notice: Even if you play 10 minutes a day, you will still need 3+ years to complete all levels ;) . \r\n\r\n\r\n*** How to play ***\r\n\r\n- The goal of the game is to clear as many boards as possible by tapping any two cards that add up to exactly 13. For example, you can tap a 10 and a 3, or an 8 and a 5. Aces count as 1, Jacks count as 11, Queens count as 12 and Kings count as 13.\r\n- You can tap away the king with just one move. To eliminate a queen, you need to match it with an ace.\r\n- You can match any uncovered card. \r\n- If there are no more available matches, press \"Draw\" to draw cards from the deck below. You can draw the entire stack three times over. \r\n\r\n\r\n♥♥ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NQNMNXD1BCL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Retro Invaders","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39026.13766032914117595.5f23d940-8c1a-4ca6-9e5f-dbbe2f94c4c5.49ac4b1a-0218-4623-9650-40d8b8a70bdb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49745.13766032914117595.5f23d940-8c1a-4ca6-9e5f-dbbe2f94c4c5.34ec4e21-00ea-49da-b08c-751ca3c5e8ba","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14910.13766032914117595.5f23d940-8c1a-4ca6-9e5f-dbbe2f94c4c5.bed41b58-3697-4720-8bfe-441e09dc99d9","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58247.13766032914117595.5f23d940-8c1a-4ca6-9e5f-dbbe2f94c4c5.05094745-45f9-469d-b8c4-0287199650c2","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"£4.19","DisplayPrice":"£2.09","Price":2.09,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["A-ZComputers.InvadersfromSpaceRemix_1wgt5v0x4j7z0"],"ContentIds":["60042f01-2de2-b2f8-5465-7443696fd35e","66831de2-a2d5-6e9f-59d0-43f10922e91c"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"Caomhain £2.10","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A surprise attack from evil alien Invaders has decimated your home world.

Dogs are the most devoted friends. You can teach your cute puppy different commands. You can play ball, travel, and just take care of it. Dogs also have a great nose and are the best detectives! In exchange for their service, each dog dreams about a tasty bone! In this coloring book, you will find exciting scenes from the life of dogs of various breeds.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4LZSV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Association Football Club Manager","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28467.13510798887423817.da0beebc-4f37-47d2-9eec-30bd57819eaa.1324549b-5c66-48e4-b0d9-6cad8adcf195","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64649.13510798887423817.5e72e6d1-940d-412d-b136-796f3c15803a.5528405c-6598-4318-aa62-75332f4ce415","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53359.13510798887423817.24133e69-78b7-48d1-ac5b-c9188ce6beb9.03331d1d-82f0-4e72-9d98-d1f60c6e7d74","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13469.13510798887423817.4c621255-4440-403c-a463-e6f33bf551c1.d037216c-1aaf-42ec-b7e0-0fa4aad6ec73","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40902.13510798887423817.8a5119d2-3f85-4b49-9bcb-fb926a31fa87.e275b751-2861-4467-8d38-614566887691","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14518.13510798887423817.65c7cde6-987f-40ab-9c55-e89020206544.411c438c-ef1e-4f04-a865-f29210fc183a","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64913.13510798887423817.e2f4a841-2d71-41c1-85af-fca5dfb7ad31.5778cb11-1fac-4618-a7e2-294745cac896","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38265.13510798887423817.4e7b249a-12c8-4748-8186-4cbfc31ee188.47951cb3-2865-481e-8ec0-24d681bec38a","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24960.13510798887423817.047e0dec-c683-4e7b-ad60-7ea57675f48c.3917308f-9944-490a-818c-00e6763cf08f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.29","Price":1.29,"AverageRating":1.8,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["75CharonSoftware.AssociationFootballClubManager_npmhh3mpf6xfa"],"ContentIds":["b4841e06-78f5-43a5-c952-760845640f12"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Select and manage any of the Premier or Football League club each with real financial abilities.

New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins.

features and a game board and it’s a perfect way to test your luck! Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nRocky Horror, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons (Or the corner game board icons, a real help for smaller screens) or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Coin slot found at the top right of the fruit machine). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. \r\n\r\nThe main features of Rocky Horror, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Trail Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four you can select a random trail mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine. When trail nudges are offered they are sometimes offered with a nudge gamble too and when you have trail nudges available you may use the nudge buster button to move all of the three main reels down one position at the cost of just one nudge, a real useful button indeed).\r\n\r\n-Hi-Lo Gamble-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you will be offered an optional prize/trail hi-lo gamble. Here you can either collect your prize, gamble with a hi-lo or possibly exchange to the game board if available. If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too. If you are lucky and get to the top of the prize/trail board you will automatically win the trail jackpot repeater).\r\n\r\n-Exchange To Game Board-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you may be offered an exchange to the game board. An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better. To select an active/lit up tube you can either press its corresponding button or press the corresponding corner icon on the game board. If any of the tubes reach the tube jackpot repeater slot you will automatically start the tube jackpot repeater game).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like the board mystery bonus games, tile games, tube games/features, holds, trail holds, real fun and too many to list and explain in detail. The game also has retro sound effects, all in all, a lot of real retro fun in one retro fruit machine-happy retro gaming!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDCJ61","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rescue Team","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31771.9007199266361050.3591468f-1fe7-4317-891f-9a6337ecb45e.482afde7-ec7b-44f8-b122-0b891952ef1f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46630.9007199266361050.63b01889-bb4b-4210-a4b1-8bc8b855b53f.1b5b04d5-3971-4a75-a08b-08ab16c5b5c6","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£3.29","Price":3.29,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["09B6C2D8.RescueTeam_hbbh9szp6erha"],"ContentIds":["31c3ee27-273b-b4ae-d779-e9004d6a47b7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mother Nature has done a number on an island paradise and the people need a hero!
